[00:06.98] If I have to go
[00:10.43] Please don't tell me when
[00:14.16] Need a little more time
[00:17.45] I hope you understand
[00:27.95] 
[00:22.49] Like a guardian, you're watching over me
[00:26.22] Through the depths of my own despair
[00:30.16] I look up to the sky and I find my peace
[00:33.98] I know you'll be there, so
[00:46.98] 
[00:38.65] Starlight, won't you lead the way down this river?
[00:42.46] Keep me afloat, keep me afloat
[00:46.30] If I ever drift away, won't you be there?
[00:49.97] Keep me afloat, keep me afloat
[01:04.97] 
[00:53.93] 'Til the end of time, make me feel safe
[00:57.50] Oh, I just need you nеxt to me
[01:01.17] Starlight, won't you lead the way down this rivеr?
[01:04.95] Keep me afloat, keep me afloat
[01:19.95] 
[01:20.42] Keep me afloat, keep me afloat
[01:35.42] 
[01:26.20] I see you through the clouds
[01:29.75] I feel you anyways
[01:33.61] You never walk out
[01:36.67] Even on my darkest days
[01:48.17] 
[01:41.91] Like a guardian, you're watching over me
[01:45.76] Through the depths of my own despair
[01:49.28] I look up to the sky and I find my peace
[01:53.39] I know you'll be there, so
[02:06.39] 
[01:58.07] Starlight, won't you lead the way down this river?
[02:01.80] Keep me afloat, keep me afloat

[02:09.41] Keep me afloat, keep me afloat
[02:24.41] 
[02:13.21] 'Til the end of time, make me feel safe
[02:16.98] Oh, I just need you nеxt to me
[02:20.50] Starlight, won't you lead the way down this rivеr?
[02:24.35] Keep me afloat, keep me afloat ('float...)
